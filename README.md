Slide-Stream is a lightweight and interactive tool designed to visualize slide presentations directly from JSON files. It transforms structured JSON data into a clean, presentation-style user interface â€” mimicking the look and feel of traditional PowerPoint or slide-based tools, right inside the browser.
